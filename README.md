Nostra is a beginner-level web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project focuses on:

Creating structured web pages using HTML

Styling and layout design with CSS

Adding basic interactivity using JavaScript

It is part of my learning journey in web development, and more improvements will be added in future versions.
